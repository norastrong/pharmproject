<p> <h2> I Got the Job! What Can I Expect? </h2> </p> 

<p> Being a pharmacist has a lot of perks. As soon as you get your license, you can start making a lot of money, even in your 
first professional job. There are also a lot of benefits to the job market itself, because while the job prospects aren't growing
very rapidly, they definitely aren't shrinking either. You can always rely on people needing pharmacists, so you may have a few options on where
to work even in your first pharmacy job. The years in school and internships begin to pay off quickly. </p>

<p> <h3> So, What Exactly Can I Expect to Earn? </h3> </p> 

<p> Well, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States pharmacists earned a median salary of $111,570 in 2010. Not too shabby!
</p> 
<p> There are is some significant variation in what the typical salary is state-to-state, with the biggest influencing factors being 
<i> demand </i> and <i>cost of living</i> in the area. </p> 
<p> Here is a chart of the average salary in each state and territory, taken from <i> <a href="http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/alex-barker-pharmd/2016/01/how-much-do-pharmacists-make-in-each-state" target="_blank"> Pharmacy Times </a> </i></p>

<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<p> According to this chart, the highest earning states for pharmacists are New York, Virgin Islands, Massachusetts, and Washington D.C., with NY coming in first at $135 K a year. 
The lowest earning states are Hawaii, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Idaho, with Hawaii coming in last at $82K. </p>
<br>
<br> 
<p>This can also be affected by where in the state you are seeking employment, for example, a pharmacist in a large city is likely to earn 
significantly more than in a rural area with few pharmacies. As long as you compare the salary you are being offered with the cost of living for your area, you should be fine even in states with a lower paid average. </p>
<br> 
<br> 
<p> Another perk of working as a pharmacist is that a lot of employers will have student loan repayment benefit packages, due to the high cost of medical school. While this often means 
working for them for a contracted period of time, and there may be a cap on how much they will reimburse, this is still an excellent opportunity to take care of a lot of your student debt while also
earning a salary and gaining experience. </p>
<br> 
<p> There are also quintessential benefits included in the nature of the job:relocation, low risk of oversaturation, steady availability, and choice in where you live are all things that pharmacists can rely on. 
Since there is a need for pharmacists nearly everywhere in the world, you have more choice in where you live and where you move since you can rely on being able to find a job almost anywhere. Additionally, because of 
the education required, the job market for pharmacists is not easily oversaturated by waves of new pharmacist. Pharmacy is also something that is consistently available and shifting for the modern world, so job prospects are usually 
growing by at least a small amount, and rarely ever shrinking. </p>
<br>

<p> If you choose to be a pharmacist, and commit to the schooling and testing required, then you are choosing a career field with comfort, reliability, and flexibility, as well as one that is emotionally rewarding, because you are a point of 
security, education, and aid for those who are ill, temporarily or chronically. Pharmacists are people that are heavily relied on by the public, and they can make or break someone's experience with medication. Overall, this career 
is one that is deeply rooted in helping others, without the fiscal and chronological strain of many other fields that do the same. </p>
