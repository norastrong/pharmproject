<p> <h2> How do you become a pharmacist? </h2> </p>

<p>
An important part of deciding a on a career is what kind of degree you need to achieve it. With pharmacy, there are a few different ways to go about getting the qualifications you need. 
</p>

<p> <h3> Education Paths </h3> </p>

<p> 
Anyone who wishes to become a pharmacist must acquire a Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (PharmD.) from an Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education accredited program.
There are a few ways you can go about this: 
<ol>
	<p><li> 6 year program: This is a PharmD program that includes undergraduate coursework as well as professional pharmacy studies, allowing you to leave the program with a PharmD. </li><br>
	<p><li> 4 year program: This is a purely professional pharmacy education program that does not include undergraduate studies. </li><br>
	<p><li> 0-6 or Early Assurance: Those who decide while they are still in High School that they want to pursue a pharmacy degree may be able to apply for an "0-6" or "early assurance" program,
	which offers guaranteed admission into a pharmacy school after you have completed at least two years of undergraduate coursework in relevant areas. </li><br>
	<p><li> Late Decision: Those who decide during or after college that they wish to pursue a PharmD are still able to apply for a 4 year pharmacy program as long as they have the 
	relevant prerequisite undergraduate experience over at least two years. </li><br>
</ol>
<br> 
Some undergraduate courses include: biology, chemistry (general and organic, physics, english, math, and economics. Professional level courses are more specific. 
<br> 
Requirements for entrance and continued attendance can vary greatly between programs. Here are a few pharmacy school's requirements as an example:

<p> <h3> I Graduated; What Now? </h3> </p>

<p> The certifications you need to be a licensed pharmacist vary by jurisdiction, however one exam you will have to pass no matter what is the North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam, or NAPLEX. </p>
<p> You also will have to take an exam on pharmacy law, a common one being the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE). Different states, however, will have different exams you are required to pass. 
These two are guaranteed, however, state-by-state there may be additional tests you are required to pass to earn your license. </p> 
<p> You also need a certain number of practical experience hours (internships), however most people complete these while they are still in school </p>
<p> Lastly, you will need to submit to a criminal background check (if it is required in your jurisdiction). </p>

<br>
